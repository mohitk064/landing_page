        <h2>About Darjeeling</h2>
        <p>Darjeeling, located in West Bengal, is known for its breathtaking views of the Himalayan peaks, its world-famous tea, and its unique blend of culture and nature. In the early 19th century, during East India Company rule in India, Darjeeling was identified as a potential summer retreat for British officials, soldiers and their families. The narrow mountain ridge was leased from the Kingdom of Sikkim, and eventually annexed to British India. Experimentation with growing tea on the slopes below Darjeeling was highly successful. Thousands of labourers were recruited chiefly from Nepal to clear the forests, build European-style cottages and work in the tea plantations. The widespread deforestation displaced the indigenous peoples. Residential schools were established in and around Darjeeling for the education of children of the domiciled British in India. By the late-19th century, a novel narrow-gauge mountain railway, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, was bringing summer residents into the town and carrying a freight of tea out for export to the world. After India's independence in 1947, as the British left Darjeeling, its cottages were purchased by wealthy Indians from the plains and its tea plantations by out-of-town Indian business owners and conglomerates.</p>

        <h2>Top Attractions</h2>
        <div class="attraction">
            <h3>Tiger Hill</h3>
            <p>Famous for its stunning sunrise views of Kanchenjunga, the third highest mountain in the world. At sunrise, the peaks of Kanchenjunga are illuminated before the sun is seen at lower elevations. From Tiger Hill, Mount Everest (8848 m) is just visible. Kanchenjunga (8598 m) looks higher than Mt. Everest, owing to the curvature of the Earth, as it is several miles closer than Everest. The distance in a straight line from Tiger Hill to Everest is 107 miles (172 km).
                On a clear day, Kurseong is visible to the south and in the distance, along with Teesta River, Mahananda River, Balason River and Mechi River meandering down to the south. Chumal Rhi mountain of Tibet, 84 miles (135 km) away, is visible over the Chola Range
                Senchel Wildlife Sanctuary is close to Tiger Hill.</p>

            <h3>Darjeeling Himalayan Railway</h3>
            <p>The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, also known as the DHR or the Toy Train, is a 610 mm (2 ft) gauge railway that runs between New Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling in the Indian state of West Bengal. Built between 1879 and 1881, it is about 88 km (55 mi) long. It climbs from about 100 m (330 ft) above sea level at New Jalpaiguri to about 2,200 m (7,200 ft) at Darjeeling, using six zig zags and three loops (originally five) to gain altitude. Ghum station is situated at an altitude of 2,258 metres (7,407 ft). Six diesel locomotives handle most of the scheduled service, with daily tourist trains from Darjeeling to Ghum  India's highest railway station and the steam-hauled Red Panda service from Darjeeling to Kurseong. Steam-enthusiast specials are hauled by vintage British-built B-Class steam locomotives. The railway's headquarters are at Kurseong.

                On 5 December 1999, UNESCO declared the DHR a World Heritage Site.[2] Two more railway lines were later added, and the site became known as one of the mountain railways of India.</p>

Since 2004, the term Darjeeling tea has been a registered geographical indication referring to products produced on certain estates within Darjeeling and Kalimpong. The tea leaves are processed as black tea, though some estates have expanded their product offerings to include leaves suitable for making green, white, and oolong teas.</p>
